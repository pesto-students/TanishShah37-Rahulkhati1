            Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
            <br>Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,</br>
            an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.</p>

                <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. 
                It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, 
                making it over 2000 years old. 
                ichard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, 
                looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, 
                and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, 
                discovered the undoubtable source.</p>
